# temp0ral-chat
Basically I'm reinventing the wheel here. This is an attempt at building a realtime chat that is minimal and ephemeral in nature. 

Now look here --> *This project is **experimental âœ¨***. 


### Run the dev environment
1. `vim models/app.go` *<-- fill out*
2. `go mod tidy`
3. `go tool templ generate`
4. `go run .`


### Stack
- Go/Gin
- Templ
- HTMX
- A tad bit of vanilla JS
- PSQL
